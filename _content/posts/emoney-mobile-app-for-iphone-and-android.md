## Here's how to get started

1\. Once you've completed the self-registration process for your eMoney client website, you will receive a website registration confirmation email.

2\. Using your smart phone, access your email and click on the URL provided. Before logging on, add or save the link to your smart phone’s Home Screen. You can also access the [mobile login screen here](https://wealth.emaplan.com/ema/SignIn?ema%2fria%2f1080financial "mobile login screen").
