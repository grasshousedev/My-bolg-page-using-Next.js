## Your eMoney client website employs advanced security features and protocols to keep your data safe, private, and secure at every hour of every day, year round.

### Our comprehensive security measures include password protection, Secure Socket Layer encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection, audits, inspections, and more. With each measure in place, you can be confident that your important information is safe and secure.

## Password Protection

You have a unique username and password, ensuring that only you can access your information. Submitting incorrect login credentials three consecutive times will automatically lock your account for 10 minutes. This is to block any manual or programmed hacking attempts. In most cases, we have no access to your username or password. However, if you decide to provide us with this information, we will never share your username and password over the phone or send it to an email address preregistration your account.

## Highest Encryption

Our system uses a 256-bit Secure Socket Layer to scramble your data, further preventing access to unauthorized users.This is the highest level of encryption currently available today,and twice the standard followed by many financial institutions,including banks.

## Secure Data

We house your important data at secure, geographically separated data centers. Physical security measures at these facilities includes 24/x7/x365 on-site personnel and closed circuit video surveillance.

These data centers also make use of fire protection, electronic shielding, and database backup procedures to ensure your data is continuously monitored and protected.

## Routine Security Testing

Your eMoney client website uses third-party security auditors and software, including TraceSecurity, TenableSecurity and WhiteHat Security, to identify vulnerabilities within your system and to assist us with remediation efforts.

## 2-Factor Authentication

Your eMoney client website employs 2-FactorAuthentication (2FA), a complete fraud detection platform that uses a dynamic risk- and rules-based approach to identify high risk

behaviors and initiate an additional layer of security. With 2FA, you are sent a verification code to your mobile phone,which you are required to input along with your username and password in order to access your personal financial website.

This additional layer of protection safeguards your sensitive financial data and strengthens the security of your account by requiring two methods of verifying your identity.

## Non-Transactional

Unlike online banking, trading or shopping websites, your money cannot be moved, withdrawn or accessed on our system.
