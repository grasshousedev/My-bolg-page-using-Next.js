For close to 30 years, Neal has provided comprehensive financial planning for individuals and families. He focuses on retirement and investment planning, tax planning and estate planning.

As a young man, Neal grew up with very limited resources and almost no financial guidance - but he was motivated. He worked hard, graduated with a B.S. in Accounting and went on to build a thriving financial planning practice. In addition, his early experiences made it easy for Neal to empathize with others and make him really want to help others avoid the financial difficulty he had to face growing up. That’s why he has a passion for working with clients personally.

Neal has written two books; “Why Smart People Lose A Fortune” and “Money Academy for Couples”. He has published over 1,200 articles on his blog, WealthPilgrim.com and has been a contributing writer for numerous financial news media organizations.

When he’s not helping clients or writing, he loves spending time with his family and playing music.
