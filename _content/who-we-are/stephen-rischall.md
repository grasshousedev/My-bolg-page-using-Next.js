By the age of thirteen Stephen began learning how to invest using his own money. This sparked his passion for personal finance which continued through college where he studied business finance and earned a special honors commendation for his role in managing the University Corporation Student Investment Fund. Soon after graduating, he joined a national brokerage firm to begin his career in financial services. Several years later he made the conscious decision to exit the brokerage business to become an independent, fiduciary financial planner.

Stephen has been recognized as an InvestmentNews “40 Under 40” honoree and was named as one of the top ten “Investopedia 100 Most Influential Advisors”. Earlier in his career he was recognized by the San Fernando Valley Business Journal as a "Valley's Trusted Advisor”. He actively serves his community through volunteerism and leadership; he is a past President of the San Fernando Valley Junior Chamber and Board Chair for the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles Young Adults Los Angeles program. In his free time Stephen enjoys backcountry skiing, mountain biking and cooking.
