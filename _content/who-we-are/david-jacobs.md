In 1996 David began his career in financial services working for one of the largest investment management firms on Wall Street. While there he worked on an eight-person team that managed over $2 Billion in assets for wealthy families, foundations and retirement plans.

David is known for his straightforward approach and reputation as a relentless advocate for his clients. In 2002, when he started practicing as an independent financial advisor, he dropped all of his brokerage sales licenses to become a “Fee-Only” fiduciary, a rarity at the time.

David is a Southern California native and enjoys giving back to his community. He is an active participant and leader in several local organizations including the Los Angeles Jewish Federation, Anti-Defamation League, JBL and the Executives. In his free time, he enjoys golfing, traveling and eating Dodger Dogs.
