    # You are a fiduciary; wouldn’t it be great if your advisor was too? Being a fiduciary is a serious responsibility, we know, and that’s why we built Navalign to be an independent fiduciary financial services firm.

    When it comes to administering your family’s estate, dealing with emotions and finances together can present unique challenges. Navalign provides personal fiduciary investment services to help trustees and executors navigate important financial decisions aligned with the best interest of beneficiaries.
