    ### Save Time

    We understand that you’re busy and we respect your time, so our 401(k) and Pension plan services are designed to allow us to do more of the heavy lifting for you. You’ll notice this right away as we guide you through the implementation process, assisting with plan design and helping participants setup their accounts.

    ### Reduce Liability

    Navalign Wealth Partners is an ERISA 3(38) Fiduciary Investment Manager. This means we share in your liability to act in the best interest of retirement plan participants. We’ll help you stay compliant by managing plan investments and adhering to a central fiduciary process.

    ### Transparent Fees

    The total cost of our 401(k) and Pension plans are often lower than our competitors. We do this by providing open architecture retirement programs, eliminating unnecessary and hidden fees in the process. Our independent approach enables us to provide access to many different retirement plan providers, finding the best fit for your situation.

    ### Quality Investments

    Unlike most of our competitors, we are not paid by the investments or companies we recommend. Instead, plan participants pay a transparent fee and we select the most appropriate, low-cost investments for your plan. That’s one of the ways we stay aligned with our clients. We can also create custom model portfolios for participants at no additional cost.

    ### Proactive Engagement

    We begin by taking the time to understand your business and to learn why you’re implementing a retirement plan in the first place. Whether it’s to maximize tax savings or attract and retain key employees, we make sure you get the most value from your plan and that you and your employees are meaningfully engaged.

    ### Participant Education

    We’re the retirement plan experts, so you don’t have to be. Both you and your employees have direct access to our experienced retirement advisors through regularly scheduled meetings. And when your employees have questions, they can contact us directly and speak to someone they know by phone or email, not a stranger in a call center.

    ### Lower Fees

    Many participants don’t understand the fees associated with their plans; in fact many believe their plans are “free”. Unlike most of our competitors, we are not paid according to the investments we recommend. This allows us to use a variety of low-cost investment options that directly impact your retirement account performance over time.

    ### Personalized Advice

    Have questions about your retirement plan? We make ourselves directly available through on-site visits, phone calls and email. Our advice goes well beyond simply explaining the details of your retirement plan. We can help you choose investments for your retirement account that make sense and answer other important personal financial questions about saving for your child’s college education, setting up your estate plan or whatever else might be on your mind.

    ### Custom Portfolios

    You’re an expert in your field, and we’re experts in ours. That’s the basis of a very effective relationship. Over the years we’ve found that many retirement plan participants are overwhelmed by the choices in their 401(k) and Pension plans. With Navalign Wealth Partners, you have access to customized model portfolios managed by our in-house team of investment experts. We can even help you determine which investments best fit your goals and risk tolerance.

    ### Skin in the Game

    At Navalign we’re held to a higher standard, taking on greater responsibility providing advice on your retirement plan. In fact, we’re fiduciaries, which means we are required to always put your interests ahead of our own. We’re here to help, and you can rest assured any advice we provide is because we believe it’s best for you.

    ### Convenient Account Access

    Accessing your retirement plan account online is easy. Review your balances, account history and make changes to investments and other important details. If you prefer, you can also receive and change information by phone, fax or mail. As always, if you have questions we welcome you to contact our team of retirement plan experts to speak with somebody directly, that knows you and your retirement plan.
