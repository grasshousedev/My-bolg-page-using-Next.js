    ### **Tax Planning**

    No one should have to pay more than their fair share of taxes. And with tax laws constantly in flux, it’s becoming more difficult to plan ahead while taking them into account. That is why we collaborate with your CPA and team of trusted tax advisors to develop sound tax strategies that are in your best interest. Proactive tax planning will align current cash flow needs with long term financial goals to identify opportunities for deferring, reducing and mitigating certain tax liabilities. We help plan, using these and other methods, to align your best interest with the tax code:



    * Retirement Savings Tax Strategies
    * Charitable Giving
    * Tax Loss Harvesting
    * Tax Diversification
    * Roth Conversions
