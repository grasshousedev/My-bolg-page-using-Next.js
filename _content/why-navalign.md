    ## Fee-Only Structure

    Our business model is 100% fee-only, not fee-based. This means our fees are transparent and we are never compensated by outside parties or broker commissions. This is a major difference you need to understand when selecting a firm. How a firm is paid goes a long way in understanding the depth of financial advice they provide to you. Fee-only helps to reduce conflicts of interest, so we may remain clearly aligned with your goals.

That’s why we chose a transparent fee-only pricing structure that is simple to understand. No commissions or hidden costs, ever! Choose the way you want to work with us and you’ll always know exactly what you’re paying for.

    #### We often times answer questions about what it means to be a fiduciary. If you want to learn more, just ask. Here are some of the most common questions we get asked about being a fiduciary financial advisor.

    <h1 class="h3 text-left">What is a Fiduciary?</h1>

    <h2 class="h6">A fiduciary is an institution or person that is held to a high standard and legally obligated to act in your best interest. Oftentimes fiduciaries are involved with financial situations which require great care, trust and honesty. At all times a fiduciary is responsible for their actions as well as their inaction. Most importantly a fiduciary must avoid conflicts of interest and personal motives when providing advice and pursuing the best outcome for your situation. If conflicts do exist, a fiduciary is required to disclose them and be as transparent as possible.</h2>

    <h1 class="h3 text-left">Who Can Be a Fiduciary?</h1>

    <h2 class="h6">Many brokers and insurance agents call themselves a “financial advisor”, but they are not a fiduciary. Navalign Wealth Partners is a Registered Investment Adviser firm with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Registered firms like us, are required to engage clients in a fiduciary capacity when providing financial advice and investment services. Other trusted professionals, such as attorneys and trustees, are also required to act as a fiduciary, in the best interest of their clients.</h2>

    <h1 class="h3 text-left">Why Should you Work with a Fiduciary Financial Advisor?</h1>

    <h2 class="h6">Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between a sales pitch and financial advice. The financial services industry is filled with conflicts of interest and that shouldn’t get in the way of helping clients make better financial decision. Fiduciary financial planners, like us, have a legal obligation to always act in our clients’ best interest and provide unbiased, objective advice. When you work with a fiduciary, you’ll have peace of mind knowing they are on your side, focused on helping you above all else.</h2>

    <h1 class="h3 text-left">How Will you Know if Someone is a Fiduciary Financial Advisor?</h1>

    <h2 class="h6">The easiest way to find out if someone is or isn’t a fiduciary is by asking them. A Fiduciary Financial Planner or Investment Adviser is obligated to share with you if they are engaging you as a fiduciary and must disclose when situations arise in which they may not be acting as a fiduciary. Many professions require registration and licensing with the proper authorities to provide fiduciary services as a business. To find out if your financial advisor is a fiduciary you can look them up here using the <a href="https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD" target="_blank" title="Navalign, LLC Investment Adviser Public Disclosure">Investment Adviser Public Disclosure system</a></h2>
