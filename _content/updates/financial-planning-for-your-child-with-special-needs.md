title: 'Financial Planning for Your Child with Special Needs '
---
### As the parent of a child with special needs, you will face many of the same obstacles that other parents face, plus you’ll cope with some unique challenges as well. These unique scenarios will impact your child’s education, [your family’s finances](https://navalign.com/updates/4-financial-priorities-young-families-should-address/), and more.

If you have a child with special needs, here are some things you may want to consider. 

## Where do you start?

Getting reliable information and support is important when you have a child with special needs. However, several professionals can help you navigate the unique challenges that come with raising a child with special needs. You may want to speak with:

· Your obstetrician, pediatrician, and primary physician

· Social workers familiar with federal, state, and community resources

· Mental health professionals (e.g., psychologists and counselors)

· Parents of other children with special needs

· Members of a community or on-line support group

· Individuals within your local school systems (e.g., the superintendent, the principal, guidance counselors, and special education teachers)

Fortunately, many cities, schools, and other institutions have support programs and services available to community members. Your state's Department of Social Services or Office for Children can help you locate state-sponsored programs such as childcare, respite care, low-cost transportation services, or other programs that can help you provide better care for your child.

Community volunteer agencies and parent groups can also counsel and educate you about the challenges of raising a child with special needs. Your local [United Way](https://www.unitedway.org/find-your-united-way), as well as other nonprofit agencies, may have programs to help you care for your child. Sports events and recreational camps are often sponsored by both local and national organizations and can give your child a chance to interact with others while having fun.

Many national organizations exist for special needs information and advocacy. These groups often have local chapters you can join that may sponsor support groups. Also, the internet has become a leading source of information and support for parents of children with special needs. Online sites offer both general and technical information and can connect you to informal and formal resources.

## Finding and paying for medical care

Because of your child’s special needs, they may need expert medical care. Learning all you can about your child's condition and treatment options, is important. You should educate yourself on ways to handle healthcare costs, and how to organize paperwork. This can help to cut down on the stress that inevitably accompanies frequent visits to health care providers. Here are some tips:

· Choose a qualified physician who responds to your child's needs, is knowledgeable about your child's condition, and who explains treatment options thoroughly

· Read your health insurance policy and find out what it does and does not cover

· Apply for Medicaid if your child is eligible for it (in most states, your child will automatically qualify for Medicaid if he or she meets the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) requirements or lives in a residential care environment)

· Join support groups affiliated with a national organization focused on your child's disability or condition

· Subscribe to publications that can alert you to new treatments, prescription drugs, and research that may benefit your child

· Keep copies of all your child’s treatment records, correspondence with your insurance company, and supporting documentation

· Draft letters that you can keep on file with child-care centers, the school nurse, babysitters, or family members that describe your child's medical needs and what to do in case of emergency

## Planning your child’s education

Federal and state special education laws, as well as the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov/), require public schools to accept children with disabilities and take whatever steps are necessary to meet their special needs. For example, bathrooms, hallways, and other physical facilities must be designed to accommodate wheelchairs. Also, a public school may have to create special programs, revise its policies and curriculum, and offer counseling and other services to students with disabilities.

All states must provide a "free and appropriate public education" to eligible children with disabilities. Make sure your child evaluated by your state and local school district to find out if they are eligible for special education services, including early intervention services starting in infancy or preschool.

## Ensuring your child's future

As the parent of a child with special needs, you'll want to find ways to protect your child's inheritance and ensure that he or she is taken care of when you die. If your child is a minor (under the age of majority, which in most states is 18) or an adult who is unable to make decisions related to their long-term welfare, your first step should be to name a guardian (e.g., a friend, relative, or legal professional) in your will. After your death, this guardian will offer advice and make decisions on your child's behalf, manage their assets, and oversee their care. Choose a guardian carefully. This person should be someone who has your child's best interests at heart.

To be eligible for most government benefits (e.g., SSI, Medicaid), your child must have minimal income and assets. If you plan on leaving your child significant assets, you could put their eligibility for these benefits at risk. However, you can leave money to your child without risking his or her eligibility for government benefits by establishing a [special needs trust](https://navalign.com/updates/trust-basics-what-you-need-to-know-about-creating-a-trust/) to hold funds that your child might otherwise inherit directly upon your death.

Funds in a properly drafted special needs trust are not considered "countable" for SSI and Medicaid eligibility purposes. A special needs trust is a complex estate planning tool, so it's best to consult an experienced estate planning attorney.

## The bottom line

If your child has any form of special needs, they will require special consideration when it comes to their education, medical needs, and will even impact how you plan your estate. These additional considerations can be costly, so it is wise to [work with a financial advisor](https://navalign.com/what-we-do/fiduciary-financial-planning/) who understands your state and local laws and can help you plan accordingly.
