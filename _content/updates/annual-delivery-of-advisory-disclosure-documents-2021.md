title: Annual Delivery of Advisory Disclosure Documents - 2021
---
## Registered Investment Adviser firms are required to file updated disclosure documents and provide clients with a summary of any material changes on an annual basis. Since our last annual update, we have made a material change to our [Form ADV](/v1619630100/Form_ADV_Part_2A_-_Firm_Brochure_-_03.25.2021_finalized_tvgrdw.pdf "Navalign, LLC Form ADV - 2021") which we are required to highlight.

Â· Our firm is no longer utilizing the DBAs Carter Jacobs and 1080 Financial Group and have removed references to the DBAs throughout the document.

Please see our [updated Privacy Policy](/v1619630110/Privacy_Policy_2021_y6v4ca.pdf "Navalign, LLC Privacy Policy - 2021"). If you would like more information about our services or a full copy of our Form ADV Part 2 free of charge, please let us know via email or telephone.

If there are any changes in your financial situation or investment objectives, contact us at your earliest convenience to schedule a time to discuss this further. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your ongoing business.
