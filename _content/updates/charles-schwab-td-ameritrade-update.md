title: Charles Schwab & TD Ameritrade Update
---
In 2019 Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade entered into an [agreement for Charles Schwab to acquire TD Ameritrade](https://www.amtd.com/news-and-stories/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/acquisition-information-center/default.aspx "Charles Schwab to acquire TD Ameritrade"). The combined company will be the largest custodian service provider for Registered Investment Advisor firms like Navalign, with over $5 Trillion in client assets across 24 million client accounts.

For years Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade have competed to provide the best wealth management experience to clients and advisors. Both companies have consistently been recognized for best-in-class technology, client service, research, innovation and more.

This combination brings together two leading firms with proud and similar histories of making investing more accessible to all. More than 40 years ago, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade started out as alternatives to traditional Wall Street brokerages. They helped lead a revolution to become the preferred model for full-service investing among tens of millions of direct investors and the go-to providers of custodial and consulting services for thousands of independent investment advisors.

As of June 2020, the deal received clearance from the Department of Justice Antitrust Division as well as [approval from TD Ameritrade shareholders](https://www.amtd.com/news-and-stories/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/TD-Ameritrade-Announces-Shareholder-Approval-of-Merger-with-Charles-Schwab-and-Closing-of-DOJ-Investigation-of-Merger/default.aspx "TD Ameritrade shareholder approval"), with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the proposal.

Integration planning is still on track, even in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020. The final integration of the two-companies is expected to take between 18 to 36 months to complete.

We are excited for this news and look forward to the benefits of increased scale, and the combination of these two industry leaders. We do not expect this to impact our ability to continue servicing clients at Navalign during this integration process and we will keep you up to date with any important news as it becomes available.

We value the trust you've placed in us and look forward to the benefits of aligning our firm with the largest and most innovative custodial service provider in the industry.
