  block_text: "# **FORM CRS - CLIENT RELATIONSHIP SUMMARY**\n\n## Introduction\n\nNavalign,
    LLC (“Navalign”), is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission. As a retail investor, you have two service choices to consider
    when working with a financial professional: an investment advisor or a broker-dealer.
    We feel it is vital for you to understand the differences between advisory and
    brokerage services in order to determine which service is right for you. We encourage
    to visit [www.investor.gov/CRS](www.investor.gov/CRS \"Form CRS information\")
    for unbiased information. There, you will find free and simple tools to research
    firms and financial professionals, as well as educational materials about investment
    advisers, broker-dealers, and investing.\n\n## What investment services and advice
    can you provide me?\n\nNavalign is a registered investment adviser offering two
    distinct investment advisory services to retail investors. Our advisory services
    include: Asset Management, and standalone financial planning/consulting for both
    individuals and businesses.\n\nAsset Management services are designed for individuals
    and families and are charged on an ongoing asset-based fee. Under this agreement
    services include portfolio design, monitoring, and discretionary maintenance.
    Asset management clients may also receive complimentary financial consulting.
    We will meet with you to understand your current financial situation, existing
    resources, goals, and risk tolerance. Based on what we learn, we’ll recommend
    a portfolio of investments that is monitored at least quarterly, and if necessary,
    rebalanced to meet your changing needs, stated goals, and objectives. We’ll offer
    you advice on a regular basis and contact you at least annually to discuss your
    portfolio. Our agreement allows us to manage your accounts on a discretionary
    basis. This means our firm has the ability to buy and sell investments in your
    account without notice to you in advance. Any limitations will be described in
    the signed advisory agreement. We will have discretion until the advisory agreement
    is terminated by you or our firm. Our firm requires a minimum annual fee of $2,000
    for our Asset Management services, which is negotiable.\n\nFinancial planning
    is also offered as a separate standalone service for anyone that is not an asset
    management client of our firm. Final services delivered and costs will vary and
    are influenced by the scope of work desired and the data provided by the client.
    Fees can be either flat rate ranging between $3,000 to $25,000 or on an hourly
    basis starting at $300 per hour.\n\nAdditional information about our advisory
    services is located in Item 4 of our Firm Brochure which is available online at
    [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.
    \"https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.\") \n\n## What fees will I
    pay?\n\nYou will be charged an ongoing fee based on the aggregate value of the
    investments in your account multiplied by a fee percentage established in your
    service agreement with us. Fees will be collected periodically, either quarterly
    or monthly, and will be based on the amount of days held for that period. Our
    maximum annual fee percentage is 1.25% however, your fee could be lower at our
    discretion. The amount of assets you have in your advisory account will influence
    the total you will pay annually. The more managed by us the more you will pay
    us, though your fee percentage may be lower. Therefore, it should be stated that
    we have a conflict of interest since encouraging you to increase the assets in
    your advisory account will increase our fees. Our firm’s fees will be automatically
    deducted from your advisory account, which will reduce the value of your advisory
    account as they are collected. \n\nThe custodian that holds your assets may charge
    you a fee for their services. This could include transaction fees when we buy
    or sell an investment. Certain types of specialized accounts or investments also
    may have an annual custodial fee. We are very aware of these potential costs and
    continuously adjust our activities to avoid these additional costs when possible.
    Custodial fees are separate to our firm’s fees and are not shared with Navalign.\n\nYou
    may also pay charges for holding certain investments we purchase for you. Some
    mutual funds, index funds, and exchange traded funds, charge fees for their management
    and operating expenses, commonly referred to as “Fund Expense Ratios”, that will
    reduce the value of your investments over time. We take these costs into consideration
    before adding these positions to your portfolio.\n\nYou will pay fees and costs
    whether you make or lose money on your investments. Fees and costs will reduce
    any amount of money you make on your investments over time. Please make sure you
    understand what fees and costs you are paying. \n\nAdditional information about
    our fees is located in Item 5 of our Firm Brochure, which is available online
    at [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.
    \"https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.\")\n\n## What are your legal
    obligations to me when acting as my investment adviser, how else does your firm
    make money and what conflicts of interest do you have?\n\nWhen we act as your
    investment adviser, we have to act in your best interest and not put our interest
    ahead of yours. At the same time, the way we make money creates some conflicts
    with your interests. You should understand and ask us about these conflicts because
    they can affect the investment advice we provide you. Here are some examples to
    help you understand what this means:\n\nOur firm utilizes TD Ameritrade, Inc.
    (“TD Ameritrade”) as our custodian of choice. To obtain business from investment
    advisors like us, custodial firms will offer certain incentives that can benefit
    us economically. Examples include: providing specialized software complimentary
    or at discount rates, and group discounts for goods and third-party consulting
    services. Since our firm may receive economic benefits as a result of our relationship
    with TD Ameritrade, there is an incentive for us to recommend clients to hold
    and place transactions with TD Ameritrade. However, we believe the benefits provided
    with our relationship with TD Ameritrade are part of a normal course of doing
    business and that those benefits outweigh the potential conflicts of interest.
    We will always seek to act in your best interest.\n\nAdditional information about
    our conflicts of interest is located in Item 10 of our Firm Brochure, which is
    available online at [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.
    \"https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/119919.\")\n\n## How do your financial
    professionals make money? \n\nOur financial professionals are employees of the
    firm and receive pay and benefits typical to most businesses. Advisor compensation
    is based on the revenue our firm collects from the advisory clients they are responsible
    for and services they provide. Support roles are salaried. All employees are eligible
    to earn bonuses and participate in profit sharing.\n\nDo you or your financial
    professionals have legal or disciplinary history? \n\nNo, our firm and financial
    professionals do not have any legal or disciplinary history to disclose. Visit
    Investor.gov/CRS for a free and simple search tool to research our firm and our
    financial professionals.\n\nAdditional Information \n\nYou can find additional
    information about our firm’s investment advisory services on the SEC’s website
    at [www.adviserinfo.sec.gov](www.adviserinfo.sec.gov \"SEC Website\") by searching

    service? Why or why not? \n\n•\tHow will you choose investments to recommend to
    me?\n\n•\tWhat is your relevant experience, including your licenses, education
    and other qualifications? What do those qualifications mean?\n\n•\tHelp me understand
    how these fees and costs may affect my investments. If I give you $10,000 to invest,
